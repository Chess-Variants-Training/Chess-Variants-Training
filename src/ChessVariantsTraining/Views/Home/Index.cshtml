<h3>@Html.ActionLink("Puzzles", "Index", "Puzzle")</h3>
<p>You can improve your tactics by doing tactics puzzles, created by the users of Chess Variants Training.</p>
<h3>@Html.ActionLink("Timed training", "Index", "TimedTraining")</h3>
<p>Improve your speed! You get a position and you have to find the winning move (or for antichess, the forced capture) as quickly as possible. How many positions can you do in one minute?</p>
<h3>@Html.ActionLink("Endgames", "Index", "Endgames")</h3>
<p>For atomic and antichess, we also have endgame training! You get a won endgame position and have to do the right moves to win it. Can you do this before the 50-move rule makes the game a draw?</p>
<h3>@Html.ActionLink("Variant960", "Lobby", "Variant960")</h3>
<p>Play chess variants... with a randomized back rank! A mix of Chess960 and variants.</p>
